/**
 * GET ALL EVENT ATTENDANCE FOR NGO (CROSS-COLLEGE VIEW)
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * This controller retrieves comprehensive attendance data for NGO users across ALL colleges
 * that participated in a specific event created by the NGO. This provides a complete overview
 * of event attendance for reporting and analytics purposes.
 *
 * USER ACCESS:
 * - NGO USERS ONLY: Can only view attendance for events they created
 * - CROSS-COLLEGE DATA: Returns attendance from all participating colleges in one response
 * - EVENT OWNERSHIP: NGOs can only access their own events (security enforced)
 *
 * ROUTE:
 * - NGO Route: GET /ngo/event/:eventId/attendance
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 * - eventId (required): ID of the event to get attendance for
 *
 * RETURNS:
 * {
 *   statusCode: 200,
 *   data: {
 *     eventId: "event_object_id",
 *     event: {
 *       location: "event location",
 *       aim: "event purpose/description",
 *       eventDate: "YYYY-MM-DD"
 *     },
 *     attendance: [
 *       {
 *         studentId: "student_object_id",
 *         name: "Student Full Name",
 *         prn: "Student PRN/Roll Number",
 *         className: "Class Name",
 *         attendanceMarkedAt: "ISO timestamp when attendance was marked"
 *       }
 *     ],
 *     totalStudentsPresent: number (total across all colleges)
 *   },
 *   message: "Event attendance retrieved successfully"
 * }
 *
 * SPECIAL CASES:
 * - If no attendance found: Returns empty attendance array with totalStudentsPresent: 0
 * - Cross-college aggregation: All students from all participating colleges combined
 * - Optimized queries: Uses pre-organized student IDs for efficient database operations
 *
 * ERROR CASES:
 * - 400: Invalid event ID format
 * - 403:
 *   - User is not an NGO
 *   - NGO trying to access event created by another NGO
 * - 404: Event not found
 *
 * USE CASES:
 * - Generate attendance reports for NGO events
 * - Analytics and statistics for event success
 * - Cross-college attendance comparison
 * - Overall event participation tracking
